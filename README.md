# NHS Number command line interface

A National Health Service (NHS) Number is a unique number allocated in a shared
numbering scheme to registered users of the three public health services in
England, Wales, and the Isle of Man.

This tool is a command line interface that parses each standard input line into
an NHS number, then validates the check digit is correct.

* If the line is a valid NHS number, then print it.

* If the line is an invalid NHS Number, or is unparseable, then print an error message.

* If the line is blank, then skip it.

## Examples

Suppose you have a text file `input.txt` that contains one NNS Number per line,
and some may be valid or invalid:

```txt
999 123 4560
999 123 4561
```

If you use Linux or macOS, then here's how to parse each line and validate it:

```sh
cat input.txt | nhs-number-cli
```

If you use Windows, then here's how to parse each line and validate it:

```sh
type input.txt | nhs-number-cli.exe
```

The commmand prints the valid NHS Number to stdout:

```stdout
999 123 4560
```

The commmand prints the invalid NHS Number to stderr:

```stderr
Error invalid line 1. Error: validate check digit failed. NHS Number: 999 123 4561
```

## Releases

You can build a release for your own platform:

```sh
cargo build --release
